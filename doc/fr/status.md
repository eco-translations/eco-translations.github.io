#  1 Priorities 

As the app is not only available in US for now, and the FAQ is mostly about how to use the app the main priority is to have the website onboarding translated.

Here's a list of what I think it's the most important to cover first. Feel free to propose other ressources

## 1.1 Priorities reward

- for each new page translated ( can just be send in a message to @jeremie): 5 points
- for each page submited to github properly ( [link and disclaimer warning properly set up](https://eco-translations.github.io/fr/  ) ) : 5 points
- for each improvment approved on already existing translations : 1 points
- Each approved pull request not covered by the points below will be rewarded : 5 to 20 depending on the ammount of work acomplished

Point can be claimed by tagging @Jeremie in discord
